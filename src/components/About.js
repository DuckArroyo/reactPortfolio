          Hello, my name is Rafael Arroyo, and I am a web development student at
          the University of Oregon. I am starting a YouTube channel in 2022.
          Love and enjoy the Pacific Northwest #UpperLeftUSA. For the past 6
          years I have been playing the game Ingress where I slay the
          competition.

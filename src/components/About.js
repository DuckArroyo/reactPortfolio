          Welcome to my first React application. Please look around and feel
          free to inquire via email. The contact form has front end functionality only at the moment, I will add backend functionality as time allows.

          Hello, my name is Rafael Arroyo, and I am a web development student at
          the University of Oregon. I am starting a YouTube channel in 2022.
          Love and enjoy the Pacific Northwest #UpperLeftUSA. For the past 6
          years I have been playing the game Ingress where I slay the
          competition.

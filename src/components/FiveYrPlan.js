        <p><strong>Move to Japan in 2025</strong></p>
        <p>I would like to be in Japan. I enjoy living in the United States but I am not really happy here, there fore I would like to work and travel for five to ten years. This is a big leap of faith but with good planning it is an achieveable goal.</p>
      <p>At this time my plans are already in motion to achieve this goal. I have just completed the University of Oregon's coding bootcamp (January 2022) and became a Full Stack Web Developer. My next task is to become proficient in Japanese. </p>
